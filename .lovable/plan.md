# NoLOL — Mobile Starting Screen Alternatives

Three layout alternatives for the home screen, all keeping the NoLOL branding and dark theme, but rebalancing the two CTAs: **Try a Challenge** and **Create Your Own**.

---

## Alternative A: Side-by-Side Cards

- **NoLOL logo + tagline** at the top
- Two equally-sized cards displayed vertically (stacked), each with:
  - An icon/illustration (🎬 for Try, ✨ for Create)
  - A short title ("Try a Challenge" / "Create Your Own")
  - One-line description
  - A CTA button (both same size, both using the pink/coral accent color but with different styles — one filled, one outlined)
- Below the cards: a small horizontal scroll preview of recent/popular challenge thumbnails
- Footer: Terms · Privacy

**Vibe:** Clean, decision-focused. User immediately sees two equal paths.

## Alternative B: Swipeable Hero Sections

- **NoLOL logo** fixed at the top
- A tab/toggle switcher with two options: **"Try a Challenge"** | **"Create Your Own"** (pill-style toggle, both equally styled)
- Each tab reveals its own content section:
  - **Try tab:** Shows the challenge carousel with thumbnails, a "Start Random Challenge" button, and the 3-step explainer
  - **Create tab:** Shows an AI sparkle animation, "Upload a photo and let AI make it funny" copy, and a "Create with AI" button
- Footer: Terms · Privacy

**Vibe:** Interactive, app-like. Keeps the screen uncluttered while giving each path full real estate.

## Alternative C: Split Screen

- **NoLOL logo + tagline** at the very top
- Screen splits into two equal halves (top and bottom), divided by a subtle gradient line:
  - **Top half:** "Try a Challenge" — with a large button, brief description ("Keep a straight face while watching something hilarious"), and a few challenge thumbnail previews peeking out
  - **Bottom half:** "Create Your Own" — with a large button, brief description ("Upload a photo and let AI turn it into a challenge"), and a sparkle/AI icon
- Both buttons are identical in size and prominence (same pink/coral color)
- Footer: Terms · Privacy

**Vibe:** Bold, visual impact. Neither option can be missed — the screen literally gives them equal space.

Each alternative will be built as a mobile-first responsive page using the existing dark theme and coral/pink accent color from the current design.
